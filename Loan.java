Q//uestion:

//Write a Java program that determines a userâ€™s eligibility for a loan. 
//The program should prompt the user to input their salary and age. The conditions for loan eligibility are:

//If the salary is greater than or equal to 20,000 or the age is less than or equal to 25, the user is eligible to apply for a loan.
//If eligible, the user is asked to enter the loan amount.
//If the loan amount is less than or equal to 50,000, the program prints "You are eligible for loan."
//If the loan amount exceeds 50,000, the program prints "Maximum loan amount is 50,000."
//If the user does not meet the initial conditions, print "You are not eligible for loan."
